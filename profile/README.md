> Get a handle on bare-metal Rust

Knurling-rs is a project by [Ferrous Systems](http://ferrous-systems.com/). Our mission is to improve the embedded Rust experience. To achieve this, we build and improve tools and create learning materials.

We believe that developing for embedded systems should be no more difficult than developing for hosted platforms.

It should be possible to use the same workflows and equally powerful tooling to develop applications and libraries for tiny embedded systems as well as powerful server-class hardware.
